#  Heart Attack Risk Detector (Neural Network from Scratch)

This project implements a **Heart Attack Risk Detector** using a neural network built entirely from scratch in Python with **NumPy**. The model is trained to predict whether a person is at risk of a heart attack based on clinical and physiological features.

The network was built by studying the guide:  
[Learn to Build a Neural Network from Scratch â€“ Yes, Really!](https://medium.com/@waadlingaadil/learn-to-build-a-neural-network-from-scratch-yes-really-cac4ca457efc)

##  Features

- Neural Network implemented **without** high-level ML libraries
-  Uses forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent
-  Handles preprocessing like:
  - Min-max normalization for numerical data
  - One-hot encoding if applicable
-  Binary classification:  
  - `0` â†’ Not at risk  
  - `1` â†’ At risk
-  Accuracy tracking across epochs

---

##  Dataset

The model is trained and tested on a labeled CSV dataset of patient health records.

###  Format:
```

Age,SysBP,Cholesterol,Risk

```

- Most columns are numeric or categorical heart-health indicators.
- `target`:  
  - `1` = Patient is at risk of heart attack  
  - `0` = Patient is not at risk

##  Neural Network Architecture

| Layer        | Description                                       |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Input Layer  | Number of features (after preprocessing)           |
| Hidden Layers| Configurable hidden layers (e.g. [32, 16])         |
| Output Layer | 1 unit with **Sigmoid** activation (risk score)    |
| Activation   | **ReLU** for hidden layers, **Sigmoid** for output |
| Loss         | **Binary Cross Entropy**                           |
| Optimizer    | **Gradient Descent** (manual, from scratch)        |
